Words go here. This example is an adaptation of Roland Winkler's example thesis \citep{winkler2015niuthesis}.

The natbib package allows differentiation between parenthetical citations (like the example above) or in-text citations. You may find \citet{booth2008craft} to be useful reading in framing your research and writing your dissertation.

%%Since this is a document you are inputting, you do not need \begin{document} or \end{document}.  You also do not need to include the preamble (the stuff before \begin{document} in the main file).  You can just start with the content of the chapter.  You can use \section, \subsection, etc as needed.  

%%You can also include figures, tables, equations, etc. If you are trying to organize your files by putting them in the relevant chapter folder, make sure to include their directory correctly. (i.e. \includegraphics{Chapter1/figure1} if the figure is in the Chapter1 folder).  You can also put figures in the main folder or separate folder if you like, just make sure to include the directory correctly.

%%You can also use \cite to reference bibliography items. Keep the references file in the main "diss" folder, and use \bibliography{references} in the main file to include it.  Then you can use \cite{ } (or \citep or \citet, depending on your literature format) to reference items in the bibliography.
